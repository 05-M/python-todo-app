# My Python To-Do List App

A simple command-line To-Do List application built with Python. This app allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, with features to add, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. All tasks are saved locally in a JSON file (`tasks_data.json`) and are loaded automatically when the application starts.

## Features ‚ú®

*   **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
*   **View Tasks:** Display all tasks with their current status (pending `[ ]` or completed `[X]`).
*   **Edit Tasks:** Modify the description of existing tasks.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
*   **Mark as Done:** Mark tasks as completed.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are automatically saved to `tasks_data.json` and loaded on startup, so you don't lose your progress.
*   **User-Friendly CLI:** Simple and interactive command-line interface.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

*   Python 3.x (Developed and tested with Python 3.13.3)

## How to Run üöÄ

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/05-M/python-todo-app.git
    cd python-todo-app
    ```
    (Replace `05-M/python-todo-app.git` with the actual URL of your repository)
    OR
    Download the `app.py` and `tasks_data.json` (if you want to start with some sample data, otherwise the app will create it) files into a new folder on your computer.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  Follow the on-screen menu to manage your tasks!

## Future Enhancements (To-Do for the To-Do App! üòâ)

*   Unmark tasks as not done.
*   Add priority levels to tasks.
*   Filter tasks (e.g., show only completed or pending).
*   Better UI/UX for the CLI.
